Prototype for a utility which prompts the user to move items in the download folder to the trash (macOS).

While working in a sound studio, i had the bad habit of never wanting to delete files. As a result, i often accumulated a large Downloads folder.
This app checks the age of files in the Downloads folder and prompts the user to move them to the trash. It also informs the user whether the files are found elsewhere in the file system, and therefore whether they're safe to delete.
